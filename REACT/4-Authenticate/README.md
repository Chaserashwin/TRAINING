In this project we learn:

we first learn how to initalise .env file and how to access that into any of our component

In .env file we declare two variables for username and password and our task is to match it with the entered variables in our login page.

Then we will move to create a Signup page where we put some conditions to create the username and password like username cant be started with number or password cant be less that 8

Then we will learn about react-router-dom which help in routing of the webpages with the help of {useNavigate}.
