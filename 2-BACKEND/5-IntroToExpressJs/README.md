# Points to be Remembered:-

### Q-> Features of EXPRESS JS ?

-> In express we don't have to mention which type of response **[res]** we are sending eg. html or plain text. It will recognize itself
-> In every Route the response **[res.send()]** will be only get once we can't use multiple

### Q-> GET vs POST ?

-> In case of Get method everything in the address bar is visible but it is fast thats why used in SEO
-> Post method is used to hide the relevant info like password so by using Post method we can't see in the address bar

### Methods:

1. GET: to retrieve data
2. POST: to send data
3. DELETE: to delete data
4. PUT/PATCH: to update data

### MVCs

- Modal
- Viewer
- Controller
