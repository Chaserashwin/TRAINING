## ENV and NODEMAILER

- Nodemailer is used to send mail to any with the UI without actually login into the account

## Working of Nodemailer:-

> In short, what you need to do to send messages, would be the following:

1. Create a Nodemailer transporter using either SMTP or some other transport mechanism
2. Set up message options (who sends what to whom)
3. Deliver the message object using the sendMail() method of your previously created transporter
