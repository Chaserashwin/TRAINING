### {useEffect} :-
>- when we access any data from API it takes a lot of cpu usage to compute the data
>- to prevent it from increasing the load time of our website we use {useEffect} to particular fetch the data when we need it.

> This is how we use the hook {useEffect} :- in App.jsx & Index.jsx

### In Index.jsx 
>we also understands how to use the functionality for show more button which will be used to display only 10 data from the api fetched by the {useState}
